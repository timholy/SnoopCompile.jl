# SnoopCompile Bot

As you change the code in your package, the precompile statements likely need to be updated too.
You can use SnoopCompile bot to automatically and continuously create precompile files.
This bot can be used offline or online.

Follow these steps to set up SnoopCompile bot for your package.

## 1 - Setting up the SnoopCompile bot configuration folder

Here, we will configure the bot in a directory `deps/SnoopCompile/` that should be added to your repository.
All configuration files for the SnoopCompile bot should go in this directory.
If you choose a different name for this directory, be sure to change the path in the configuration steps below.

## 2 - Create the precompile script

You will need a [precompile script](@ref pcscripts), here called `example_script.jl`, that "exercises" the functionality you'd like to precompile.
If you write a dedicated precompile script, place it in the bot configuration folder.

Alternatively, you may use your package's `"runtests.jl"` file.
While less precise about which functionality is worthy of precompilation,
this can slightly simplify configuration as described below.

## 3 - Create the script that runs `snoop_bot`

The `snoop_bot` function generates precompile statements and writes them to
a file that will be incorporated into your package.
`snoop_bot` requires a few settings, which can be most easily generated by [`BotConfig`](@ref).
The script that runs `snoop_bot` should be saved in your configuration directory,
with a name like `snoop_bot.jl`.

The example below (from [here](https://github.com/aminya/Zygote.jl/blob/SnoopCompile/deps/SnoopCompile/snoop_bot.jl)) supports multiple operating systems, multiple Julia versions, and "blacklists" a function whose precompilation would be problematic:

```julia
using SnoopCompile

botconfig = BotConfig(
  "Zygote";                            # package name (the one this configuration lives in)
  os = ["linux", "windows", "macos"],  # operating systems for which to precompile
  version = [v"1.4.1", v"1.3.1"],      # supported Julia versions
  blacklist = ["SqEuclidean"],         # exclude functions (by name) that would be problematic if precompiled
  exhaustive = false,                  # do not remove statements that fail to eval
)

snoop_bot(
  botconfig,
  "$(@__DIR__)/example_script.jl",
)
```

If you choose to use your "runtests.jl" file as your precompile script, configuration can be as simple as specifying just the name of the package:

```julia
using SnoopCompile

snoop_bot(BotConfig("MyPackage"))
```

Finally, you could use package loading as the only operation,
with `snoop_bot(config, :(using MyPackage))`.

To selectively exclude some of your tests from running by SnoopCompile bot, use the global SnoopCompile_ENV::Bool variable.
```julia
if !isdefined(Main, :SnoopCompile_ENV) || SnoopCompile_ENV == false
  # the tests you want to skip in SnoopCompile environment
end
```
`snoop_bot` uses different strategies depending on the Julia version:

- On Julia 1.2 or higher, it identifies methods for precompilation based on [`@snoopi`](@ref macro-snoopi);
- On Julia 1.0 or 1.1 (which do not support `@snoopi`), it identifies methods for precompilation based on [`@snoopc`](@ref macro-snoopc).

You can override this default behavior with a keyword argument, see [`snoop_bot`](@ref) for details.

## 4 - Optionally test the impact of your precompiles with `snoop_bench`

Call [`snoop_bench`](@ref) to measure the effect of adding precompile files.
It takes the same parameters as `snoop_bot` above.
You can run this manually, or choose to run it during automatic precompile file generation.
To perform it automatically, create a `snoop_bench.jl` script in the bot configuration directory.
This should be nearly identical to your `snoop_bot.jl` file, but calling `snoop_bench`
instead.
Note that benchmarking has the option of different performance metrics,
`snoop_mode=:snoopi` or `snoop_mode=:run_time` depending on whether you want to measure inference time or the run time of your precompile script.

## 5 - Configure the bot to run with a GitHub Action file

You can create the precompile files automatically when you merge pull requests to `master` by adding a workflow file under `.github/workflows/SnoopCompile.yml`.
This file should have content such as the example below.
Lines marked with `NOTE` deserve special attention as likely places you may
need to adjust the configuration.

```yaml

You can learn more about these files and the workflow process in the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow).
Examples of such files in projects can be found in other packages, for example
[Zygote](https://github.com/aminya/Zygote.jl/blob/SnoopCompile/.github/workflows/SnoopCompile.yml).
